      <description>When the Clippers did beat the Lakers&#39; small line-up put LeBron James at the center postion in the 4th quarter. Many including LeBron himself criticized the bad defense
LeBron says he knew he wouldn&amp;#39;t have what he needed tonight after four straight days off. Emphasized that in the lineup with him and Melo at the 4 and 5, he was &amp;quot;pretty shitty&amp;quot; on the defensive end. But says that he was just grateful to be out there.</description>
