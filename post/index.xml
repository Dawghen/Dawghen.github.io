      <description>When the Clippers did beat the Lakers&#39; small line-up put LeBron James at the center postion in the 4th quarter. Many including LeBron himself criticized the bad defense
LeBron says he knew he wouldn&amp;#39;t have what he needed tonight after four straight days off. Emphasized that in the lineup with him and Melo at the 4 and 5, he was &amp;quot;pretty shitty&amp;quot; on the defensive end. But says that he was just grateful to be out there.</description>

      <title>Why Gavin Lux couldn&#39;t accept the fly-out </title>

      <description>We put the Statcast info on every pitch and hit. It contains more informations than our intuition sometimes. The estimated batting average, estimated slugging from the exit velocity and the launch angle shows Gavin&amp;rsquo;s hit could have been a homer or an extra base hit at least. Gavin must have felt it&amp;rsquo;d be a bif fly after he hit it hard.

      <description>Aroldis Chapman, the elite closer of the New York Yankees is well-known as 100 mph fastball and a hard slider. He has been seeking his 3rd pitch type and finally seems to succeed in adding a new pitch type. He threw the splitters 3 times (out of 199 ) last season. From the animated pics, Chapman&amp;rsquo;s usage of the splitters are over 10% this season. (Currently, 13.3%)
This 100 mph closer is using the new pitch as a winning shot already.</description>
