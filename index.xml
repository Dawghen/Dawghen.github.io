      <description>KAT had a good game but couldn&amp;#39;t steer T-wolves to victory.      LeBron James gave a great performance with the absence of AD but couldn&amp;#39;t steer the team to victory.        Brandon Ingram steered a team to victory against the Blazers.      No Doncic, No Porzingis, No Tim Hardaway Jr., No Clever, yet Brunson is dealing against the T-wolves.</description>

      <description>Kenrich Williams is a worth watching player.      SGA continues amazing clutch performances.      Healthy Joel Embiid is unstoppable.      Stephen Curry gave a great performance on the 4th quarter after extra mid-game rest.      Tyrese Haliburton, the sophomore of the King, keeps strong with the absence of Fox.      Dejounte Murray gave a great performance against the Clippers.</description>

      <description>The Blazers beat the Grizzlies, the hottest team in the league right now. The Norm&amp;#39;s clutch performance shone.      LaVine was out but DeRozan saved the Bulls.      Jaylen Nowell backed up Anthony Edwards. He showed good shot-creating skill and a spot-up 3 point jumper.      Robert Covington has been great as a sixth man of the Blazers.</description>

      <description>   There&amp;#39;s a rumor 5 teams pursue Caris LeVert of the Pacers. This could be a good showcase against the Pistons.      No Irving. No Harden. No Harris. The slim reaper is dealing.      Cade Cunningham continues improved performance. The top drafted prospect rising   </description>

      <description>When the Clippers did beat the Lakers&#39; small line-up put LeBron James at the center postion in the 4th quarter. Many including LeBron himself criticized the bad defense
LeBron says he knew he wouldn&amp;#39;t have what he needed tonight after four straight days off. Emphasized that in the lineup with him and Melo at the 4 and 5, he was &amp;quot;pretty shitty&amp;quot; on the defensive end. But says that he was just grateful to be out there.</description>

      <title>Why Gavin Lux couldn&#39;t accept the fly-out </title>

      <description>We put the Statcast info on every pitch and hit. It contains more informations than our intuition sometimes. The estimated batting average, estimated slugging from the exit velocity and the launch angle shows Gavin&amp;rsquo;s hit could have been a homer or an extra base hit at least. Gavin must have felt it&amp;rsquo;d be a bif fly after he hit it hard.

      <description>Aroldis Chapman, the elite closer of the New York Yankees is well-known as 100 mph fastball and a hard slider. He has been seeking his 3rd pitch type and finally seems to succeed in adding a new pitch type. He threw the splitters 3 times (out of 199 ) last season. From the animated pics, Chapman&amp;rsquo;s usage of the splitters are over 10% this season. (Currently, 13.3%)
This 100 mph closer is using the new pitch as a winning shot already.</description>

      <description>Dawg&amp;amp;Hen, or D&amp;amp;H try to add more joy to various topics with a visual impact. For example, we start with normal baseball highlight clips which the official MLB highlight missed out. And eventually, weâ€™d include pitch-info, sabermetrics, and so on, whatever if it can make more fun in the ballgame or provide baseball fans food for thought.</description>
