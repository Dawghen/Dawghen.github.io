      <description>Aroldis Chapman, the elite closer of the New York Yankees is well-known as 100 mph fastball and a hard slider. He has been seeking his 3rd pitch type and finally seems to succeed in adding a new pitch type. He threw the splitters 3 times (out of 199 ) last season. From the animated pics, Chapman&amp;rsquo;s usage of the splitters are over 10% this season. (Currently, 13.3%)

      <description>Dawg&amp;amp;Hen, or D&amp;amp;H try to add more joy to various topics with a visual impact. For example, we start with normal baseball highlight clips which the official MLB highlight missed out. And eventually, weâ€™d include pitch-info, sabermetrics, and so on, whatever if it can make more fun in the ballgame or provide baseball fans food for thought.</description>
